This is a scraper that runs on [Morph](https://morph.io).

To get started [see the documentation](https://morph.io/documentation)

## Development

Set up a local development copy of the scraper by running:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/openaustralia/alaveteli_versions
cd alaveteli_versions
bundle
```

Then run regression tests and audit the scraper style with:

``` bash
bundle exec rake
```
